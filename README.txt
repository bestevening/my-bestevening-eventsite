Detailed explanation of Event planning for TON

The BESTEVENING team specializes in creating modern entertainment programs for various events, celebrations, and family gatherings. Over the past five years, they have served more than 1,000 families, engaging around 100,000 participants in their programs. In the last three years, they've expanded to multiple teams of hosts in major cities across Russia and continue to provide their services.

BESTEVENING is currently ranked in the top 10 on Avito and holds the first position among event industry competitors, thanks to the uniqueness of their modern content and the interactive engagement between participants and hosts.

Building on their experience, the team envisions a global need for their event concept. They plan to create a unified resource called BESTEVENING based on the TON blockchain. This platform allows event organizers to customize event flow using their own show program designs, with interactions between hosts, the website, and participants. The website has a content builder, and organizers can control it through a smartphone app or an admin panel.

The content includes quizzes, NFT quests, karaoke battles with sound analysis, dance battles with trackers or smartphones, and other unique developments. Winners of each stage are rewarded with tokens, and a collective prize pool is generated to keep participants engaged after events.

Participants can access BESTEVENING via QR codes or a Telegram bot. They can connect their wallets to receive rewards or create a new wallet. They engage with the program by making bets and starting games, including quizzes where questions appear on the main screen, and answer options on their smartphones.

The team plans to distribute coins to participants initially, and participants can buy more if they run out. The team's revenue sources include token transfer fees, betting fees, and withdrawal fees. They also sell subscriptions for access to the organizer's resource and offer the ability for event organizers to sell subscriptions for their show programs created within the BESTEVENING platform.

Additionally, they plan to explore partnerships for advertising various services, like wedding salons, travel agencies, florists, rental services, banquet halls, and more. They intend to create unique NFT collections for special occasions and reward participants with these NFTs.

The team will regularly fund the prize pool with weekly events and have monthly prize draws for participants from different events. Their approach aims to expand the TON community by engaging with event attendees and promoting the network.

Over the next five years, they plan to have teams of event organizers in major cities with 5-10 members each, conducting events for 50-500 participants at various locations.

Currently, they are looking for developers and collaborators to join their global-scale project, which offers a unique concept with minimal regulatory pressure. Investors can participate in the project to achieve its goals. The team is open to commission-based arrangements with lifelong payouts and is committed to promoting and growing BESTEVENING. Their needs include website development on the TON blockchain, website design, smart contract development, integration of OpenAI for creating unique quizzes and quizzes based on AI, integration of AI for audio and video content, and a creative manager for promotion and marketing.

They are excited about their growth prospects and the potential to revolutionize the event industry.
